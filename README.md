# Pokemon-Card-AR
ARKit project implemented in the Pokemon universe

To add a new pokemon:

Considering you are adding Charmander:
- add 3d model Charmander.obj
- add pokemon card image Charmander.png to be detected (after adding it, remember to update it's size on asset. Otherwise it will be zero and the app will not detect it)
- optional: add a profile image for Charizard :)
- add a case Charizard into enum PokemonFactory.
